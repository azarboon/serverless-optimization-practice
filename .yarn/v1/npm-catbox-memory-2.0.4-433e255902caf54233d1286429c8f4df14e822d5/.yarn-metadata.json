    "readme": "catbox-memory\n=============\n\nMemory adapter for [catbox](https://github.com/hapijs/catbox).\n\nLead Maintainer - [Wyatt Preul](https://github.com/geek)\n\nCurrent version: [![Current Version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/catbox-memory.svg)](https://www.npmjs.org/package/catbox-memory) [![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/hapijs/catbox-memory.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/hapijs/catbox-memory)\n\n### Options\n\n- `maxByteSize` - sets an upper limit on the number of bytes that can be stored in the\n  cache. Once this limit is reached no additional items will be added to the cache\n  until some expire. The utilized memory calculation is a rough approximation and must\n  not be relied on. Defaults to `104857600` (100MB).\n- `allowMixedContent` - by default, all data is cached as JSON strings, and converted\n  to an object using `JSON.parse()` on retrieval. By setting this option to `true`,\n  `Buffer` data can be stored alongside the stringified data. `Buffer`s are not\n  stringified, and are copied before storage to prevent the value from changing while\n  in the cache. Defaults to `false`.\n\nNote: the maximum allowed value for `ttl` is `2^31-1`, which is around 24.8 days.\n",
