Accept will parse the headers of a HTTP request and tell you what the preferred encoding is, what language should be used, and what charsets and media types are accepted.\n\nAdditional details about Accept headers and content negotiation can be found in [IETF RFC 7231, Section 5.3](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-5.3).\n\n## API\n\nFor information on using Accept see the [API documentation](API.md).\n",
