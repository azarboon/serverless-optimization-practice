    "readme": "#peekaboo\n\nA Peekable node stream.\n\nA Peekaboo stream works just like a `PassThrough` stream, it can be piped to and from without any transformation of the chunks. The difference is that a Peekaboo stream will emit each chunk as a `peek` event on an EventEmitter of your choosing, letting you spy on stream chunks in an uninvasive way.\n\n[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/hapijs/peekaboo.png)](http://travis-ci.org/hapijs/peekaboo)\n\nLead Maintainer - [Eran Hammer](https://github.com/hueniverse)\n\n## Example\n\nWe can report the download process of a request by peeking on response stream events:\n\n```javascript\n'use strict';\n\nconst Events = require('events');\nconst Fs = require('fs');\nconst Https = require('https');\nconst Peekaboo = require('peekaboo');\n\nconst emitter = new Events.EventEmitter();\nconst peek = new Peekaboo(emitter);\n\nHttps.get('https://codeload.github.com/hapijs/hapi/zip/master', (res) => {\n\n    res.pipe(peek).pipe(Fs.createWriteStream('./hapi.zip'));\n\n    let downloaded = 0;\n    emitter.on('peek', (chunk) => {\n\n        downloaded += chunk.length;\n        const pct = (downloaded / res.headers['content-length'] * 100).toFixed(1);\n        process.stdout.write(pct + '% downloaded\\r');\n    });\n});\n```\n",
